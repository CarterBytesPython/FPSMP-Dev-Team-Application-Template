# How This Application Works
1. Click "Use this template" (or fork this repo)
2. Create your own copy of this repo under your GitHub account.
3. Read everything carefully.
4. Complete the written questions and coding tasks in Skript.
5. Send @craycrayalec (JoblessPilot, CarterBytes, Carter, however you want to refer to me) the link to your completed application on Discord.

There is no time limit. Take as long as you need, we care far more about quality than quantity. Do be warned, however: If you pass this application, I will reach back out to you for an interview which will contain coding tasks with a time limit.
